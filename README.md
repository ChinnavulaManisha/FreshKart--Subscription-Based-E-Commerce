#🛒 FRESHKART – Subscription-Based E-Commerce Platform 🌱✨
Proud to share my latest project: FRESHKART, a modern subscription-based e-commerce web application designed to simplify recurring purchases of daily essentials like groceries, fruits, vegetables, and household items. Unlike traditional platforms such as Flipkart or Blinkit where users must place orders repeatedly, FreshKart enables automatic scheduled deliveries through subscriptions — saving time and effort for customers. 🚀📦

#🔑 Key Features:
🔁 Subscription-Based Ordering (Daily / Weekly / Monthly)
🛍️ One-Time Order Option Along with Subscriptions
📅 Smart Delivery Scheduling & Auto-Renewal
🔐 Secure Authentication with OTP Verification
👤 User Profile & Subscription Management
🧾 Order History & Billing Details
📦 Product Management Dashboard (Admin)
🔔 Real-Time Order & Subscription Status Tracking
📱 Responsive UI for All Devices

#👉 User Flow:
Click on Get Started to explore available products
Select products and choose a subscription plan
Complete authentication using OTP
OTP will be generated and displayed in the backend terminal
Subscription is activated and deliveries begin automatically

#💻 Tech Stack:
🌐 Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS
⚙️ Backend: Node.js
💽 Database: MongoDB
🔐 Authentication: OTP-Based Login
🔄 State Management: React Hooks

#💡 This project helped me understand subscription-based business models, full-stack development with the MERN stack, backend authentication flows, and building scalable e-commerce systems for real-world use cases.
